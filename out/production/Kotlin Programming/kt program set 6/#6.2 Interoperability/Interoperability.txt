Kotlin and Java are actually Interoperable
that is you can call a java function from a kotlin file and vice versa

You can have JAVA and KOTLIN file within the same project


How JAVA code runs?

-> 1. Compile Time [Handled by JDK that contains the compiler]

   		First the compiler converts the [Java Code(.java)] -> [Byte Code(.class)]
   		Byte Code is JVM understandable simple code
   		Byte Code is actually the .class file

   2. Runtime[Handled by JVM]

   		Then at Runtime JVM executes the code


How Kotlin code runs?

-> 1. Compile Time [Handled by JDK that contains the compiler]

   		First the compiler converts the [Kotlin Code(.kt)] -> [Byte Code(.class)]
   		Byte Code is JVM understandable simple code
   		Byte Code is actually the .class file

   2. Runtime[Handled by JVM]

   		Then at Runtime JVM executes the code

So actually the whole code in kotlin file is converted to the similar
corresponding java code in .class file
So now the java class file and kotlin class file both are in java format
So they become interoperable
