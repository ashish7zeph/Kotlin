In IntelliJ IDEA you will find above - Tools(click) -> Kotlin(click) -> Kotlin REPL(click)

This will open a window at the bottom

Purpose of REPL is - Inside REPL you can type your Kotlin Code as quickly as possible
	(just like in python shell)

Press - CTRL + Enter (to execute the code)

example-

	-> 1 + 2	(CTRL + Enter)
	= 3
	-> 10 / 7
	= 1
	-> 10.0 / 7
	= 1.42857
	-> print("Hello")
	= Hello

Use of REPL - If you want to run a short code from inside a bigger code without
running the whole code

example-

	-> var str = "Hello"	(Press Enter only)
	-> str = str + " World"	(Press Enter only)
	-> print(str)			(Press CTRl + Enter)
	= Hello World
